//This program prompts the user to enter the number of rounds they want to play and keeps track of the score for each round. It also includes error checking to ensure that the user enters a valid number of rounds and a valid choice for each round. At the end of the game, it declares the winner based on the total scores accumulated throughout the game.

Note that this program assumes that the user will enter a valid number of rounds and a valid choice for each round. If the user enters an invalid value, the program will display an error message and repeat the corresponding round.
